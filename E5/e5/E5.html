	<h3 class="left-border">Setup</h3>
	<p>Although this exercise has you run code in your browser, you need to have Node.js installed on your system to run the code quality checker. If you haven't already installed Node.js and the npm package manager, follow the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> now.</p>
	<p>Once you have Node.js installed, create a directory <code>exercise5</code> and extract the contents of <a href="e5_starter.zip">this starter folder</a> into the directory.</p>
	<p>You can fetch the code quality tool (also known as a "linter"), <a href="https://eslint.org/" target="_blank">ESLint</a>, by running the following command in the <code>exercise5</code> directory:</p>
	<div class="code">
		<pre>npm install</pre>
	</div>
	<p>This will fetch ESLint into the <code>node_modules</code> subdirectory. You will be able to run it on all the JavaScript files in <code>exercise5</code> directory by running the command:</p>
	<div class="code">
		<pre>npm run lint</pre>
	</div>
	<p>The code you submit should start with <code>'use strict';</code> in each JavaScript file and running ESLint using the command above should not output any errors or warnings. <strong>Any errors or warnings will be used to deduct style points.</strong></p>

	<h3 class="left-border">Problem 1: JavaScript Date Picker (40 points)</h3>
	<p>For this problem, you will be implementing two interactive <code>DatePicker</code> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=datepicker&amp;gws_rd=ssl#" target="_blank">displays</a> using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
	<p>In your <code>exercise5</code> directory create a file <code>DatePicker.js</code> that implements a JavaScript class named <code>DatePicker</code> that can be used as in the following example:</p>
	<pre>let datePicker = new DatePicker("div1", function (id, fixedDate) {
	console.log("DatePicker with id", id,
		"selected date:", fixedDate.month + "/" + fixedDate.day + "/" + fixedDate.year);
	});
	datePicker.render(new Date("July 4, 1776"));</pre>
	<p>The constructor takes an argument consisting of the <code>id</code> attribute for an existing div and a date selection callback function. When a date is selected the callback function should be called with the <code>id</code> argument and an object containing the properties <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>year</code> with the number encoding of the date (e.g. {month: 1, day: 30, year: 2016} is the encoding of January 30, 2016).</p>
	<p>The object should have a <code>render</code> method that takes one argument consisting of a <code>Date</code> object that selects a particular month (the object can refer to any time within the month). When <code>render</code> is invoked it replaces the contents of the date picker's div with HTML that displays a small one-month calendar such as those you might see in a travel reservation website:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The calendar must display the days of the selected month in a grid with one line for each week and one column for each day of the week.</li>
		<li>Weeks run from Sunday on the left to Saturday on the right. The calendar must contain a header row displaying abbreviations for the days of the week, such as "Su", "Mo", etc.</li>
		<li>Each day of the month is displayed as a number.</li>
		<li>Some weeks when displayed in the date picker may contain days not in the selected month. These days should be displayed as the number in their respective month, but in a dimmed fashion to indicate they are not part of the current month.</li>
		<li>All weeks displayed should contain at least one day belonging to the current month. Most months will display 5 weeks, but some months may display 4 or 6 depending on the days. The number of rows in your calendar should not be fixed.</li>
		<li>The calendar must display the name of the month and year at the top of the calendar. In addition, it must display controls such as "&lt;" and "&gt;" that can be clicked to change the calendar's display to the previous or next month.</li>
		<li>Clicking on a valid day of the current month should invoke the callback specified on the constructor with the arguments described above. Clicking on days belonging to months other than the current month should not invoke the callback.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Once you have created the JavaScript class, we have provided a file <code>datepicker.html</code> (you do not need to modify this html file) containing two empty div elements, plus a bit of JavaScript code that invokes the DatePicker class to display a date picker in each of the divs. One of the date pickers initially displays the current month and the other displays the month of January 2010. It should be possible to change the month of each date picker <em>independently</em> using the controls on that date picker.</p>
	<p>The provided html file has no styling so please create a stylesheet with the filename <code>datepicker.css</code> to apply styling to the calendars and make them look nice. The corresponding link tag that requires the css file has already been added for you in the html file.</p>

	<h3 class="left-border">Additional Requirements, Hints, etc.</h3>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>You may use the ECMAScript 2015 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" target="_blank"><code>class</code> syntax or function constructor</a>.</li>
		<li>You may not use jQuery or any other JavaScript library package in this exercise. If you were developing a real website then you should definitely take advantage of existing JavaScript libraries, but for this exercise we want you to learn about the low-level foundational JavaScript/DOM features.</li>
		<li>You may, however, use any JavaScript built-in functions. For example, you may find the following built-in functions useful in this exercise:
		<ul>
			<li>Methods of the Date class.</li>
			<li><code>parseInt</code>, <code>parseFloat</code>, <code>isNaN</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You may find some of the following DOM element properties useful in this exercise:
		<ul>
			<li><code>firstChild</code></li>
			<li><code>nextSibling</code></li>
			<li><code>tagName</code></li>
			<li><code>textContent</code></li>
			<li><code>innerHTML</code></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The JavaScript function <code>console.log</code> is very useful for debugging. It takes a string argument, which it prints to the JavaScript log. You can display this log with "More Tools → Developer Tools → JavaScript console" in the Chrome control menu. If you are having trouble figuring out what is happening in your JavaScript, sprinkle <code>console.log</code> statements around your code so you can see which code is being executed.</li>
		<li>You may also find the <code>debugger</code> statement useful in debugging. If the text "<code>debugger;</code>" is executed in a JavaScript program, it causes the program to drop into the JavaScript debugger. This is analogous to a breakpoint, except that your code can control when it triggers.</li>
		<li>If nothing seems to be happening in your JavaScript code, it's possible that your code contains an error that is causing it to be aborted. To find out if this is happening, open the JavaScript console to see if there are any errors.</li>
		<li>The JavaScript console and browser DevTools will be your best friends for the remaining exercises. We encourage you to spend some time this exercise learning how these tools work.</li>
		<li>When running ESLint, make sure the <code>.eslintrc.json</code> (hidden file) is present, or ESLint will throw an error. You can use the command <code>ls -a</code> (<code>dir /a</code> in a Windows command line) to view all the files in your current directory, including hidden files.</li>
		<li>If ESLint output shows a lot of style issues, you can ask ESLint to fix many of them for you by running <code>npm run lint -- --fix</code>.</li>
	</ul>

	<section>
	<h3 class="left-border">Style Points (10 points)</h3>
	<p>Your JavaScript must be clean (appropriate use of classes, no global variables), readable, and ESLint warning-free.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	<h3 class="left-border">Submission Procedure</h3>
	<p>Create a folder with your netid as the name. This directory should include the starter files we gave you along with code files you created or modified for the problem, including <code>DatePicker.js</code> and <code>datepicker.css</code>. Make sure your submission runs <code>npm run lint</code> and <code>npm test</code> with no errors. Remove the 'node-modules' folder and any other folder your ide may have created. 'node-modules' folder is really large, and we dont want to upload/download it when we can recreate. The submission folder should be clean and should not contain any unwanted files. Zip the folder and submit it on elearning. Failing to follow the submission procedure will result in loss of entire styling points.</p>
