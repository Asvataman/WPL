    <p>
      Create a <em>single</em> HTML document that presents two different
      appearances, determined by the document's CSS stylesheet. Your HTML file
      should be called <code>index.html</code> and the document's title should
      be "Exercise 2". Along with this HTML document, you should also
      create two stylesheets called <code>styleA.css</code>
      and <code>styleB.css</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the HTML file links to <code>styleA.css</code>, then it should appear
      like this ("Version A"):
    </p>
    <div class="center-block margin-v">
      <img class="img-responsive" src="Exercise%202_%20CSS_files/project1versionA.png" alt="Problem
      1 Version A">
    </div>
    <p>
      If the HTML file links to <code>styleB.css</code>, then it should appear
      like this ("Version B"):
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note: The D in the screenshot is highlighted to show you what
      space the text should occupy. Your solution should not style the D with a
      blue background.</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="center-block margin-v">
      <img class="img-responsive" src="Exercise%202_%20CSS_files/project1versionB.png" alt="Problem
      1 Version B">
    </div>

    <h4 class="left-padding">Style A Specifications</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>There should be six box elements, lined up vertically.</li>
      <li>All boxes are centered horizontally and equally spaced vertically.
      When the browser window is resized, the spacing between the boxes should
      change (they should be equally spaced vertically across the page).
      However, the boxes themselves should never overlap or change size.</li>
      <li>Each box is 100x100 pixels, with a 1px line (color: #687291) on top.
      Text is centered horizontally.</li>
      <li>Boxes alternate colors (colors: #dfe1e7, #eeeff2).</li>
      <li>The final element (color: #687291) has a 4px, black border and the
      text is centered vertically.</li>
      <li>The font in all elements is Tahoma, 40 pixels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="left-padding">Style B Specifications</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Five box elements, lined up horizontally in the top left corner.</li>
      <li>Boxes do not wrap with window resizing (i.e., boxes A through E should
      stay on the same line even if your browser window is too small to display
      them all).</li>
      <li>The last box is positioned in the bottom right corner of the window
      and stays there even when the window resizes.</li>
      <li>Each box is 100x150 pixels (color: #eeeff2), with a 10px dotted line
      (color: #D0D0FF) on the left. Boxes are separated by 10 pixels of
      space.</li>
      <li>When hovering over a box, the cursor changes to a hand and the box and
      font colors change (colors: yellow, goldenrod, respectively).</li>
      <li>The font in all elements is Tahoma, 40 pixels.</li>
      <li>There are 10 pixels of space between the letters and the edge of the
      box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If a property is not outlined in these specifications (e.g., space between
      elements in style B and edge of window) you should choose something
      reasonable.
