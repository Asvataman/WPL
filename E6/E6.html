	<p>The main objective of this exercise is to apply the concepts (API, and localStorage) that you learnt in the class this week to build a simple web app. This exercise will also solidfy your skills in event handling and DOM manipulations.</p>
	<p>Specifically, build a web app where users can search for movies using the OMDb API and save favorites to a watchlist stored in localStorage. The watchlist should be viewable on a separate page. Users of the app should be able to navigate between the two pages.</p>
